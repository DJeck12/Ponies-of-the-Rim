		<description>Half-insect, half-horse, changelings have existed alongside ponies since the earliest times of history, but have never been able to communicate. Being intelligent but driven by instinct, changelings reject the idea of ​​technological development and prefer to build primitive hives like their ancestors.

Your hive has been plundered by poachers and you have all been chained and taken away from your home planet to be sold. Luckily for you, your species is not on the extermination list and the poachers have been traced by space fighters for justice. The ship you are all in crashes and you manage to escape from your prison cells. Having taken up the fight with panicking pirates, you were able to win and take one of the escape pods. Having landed on the planet, you realize that not everyone was able to survive the landing on the surface. The story of your hive begins.</description>

		<label>Lonely alicorn</label>
		<description>Long ago, in the golden age of Equestria, the ancient alicorns ruled over entire countries and world. They were demigods, possessed extraordinary abilities and believed that it would always be so. Unfortunately, many years of relations between alicorns and ponies led to the extinction of the ancient alicorn race, leaving behind hybrids of the superior race with ordinary ponies.
		
The legacy of the great power remained in the face of the weakened ancestors of the alicorns and you are part of this legacy. You arrive on this planet with the goal of continuing the history of the alicorns by ruling your own settlement. But first, you will need followers or friends.</description>
